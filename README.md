# Locales support for musl
Locale program for musl libc

This is ```/usr/bin/locale```, which works on musl libc (with limitations in musl itself).
To install, use ```cmake . && make && sudo make install``` on musl-capable distro.

English, Russian, Swiss german and French are included, also .pot file.

*HINT: To add/remove languages to install, you can either:*
- Edit the `po/LOCALES` & `musl-po/LOCALES` files
- Overwrite the `LOCALES` variable when invoking `cmake` as follow:

```
cmake -DLOCALES="fr_FR;de_CH" .
```

> NOTE: locales have to be separated by a `;` semi-colon.
